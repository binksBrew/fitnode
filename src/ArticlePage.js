    content: `
      HRV reflects autonomic nervous system activity and is linked to glucose regulation. Reduced HRV indicates impaired autonomic function, increasing risks of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Monitoring HRV can help identify metabolic issues early and guide proactive health management.

    title: "Resting Heart Rate (RHR) and Cardiovascular Health",
    content: `
            RHR measures heartbeats per minute at rest and is key to cardiovascular fitness. Normal RHR ranges from 60â€“100 bpm; athletes often have lower rates. Elevated RHR increases cardiovascular risks, but lifestyle changes like exercise and stress management can improve it.

    title: "Interconnection Between HRV, RHR, and Glucose Levels",
    content: `
            HRV, RHR, and glucose levels are interconnected. Hyperglycemia often reduces HRV, signaling autonomic dysfunction. Monitoring all three provides a holistic view of health, enabling tailored interventions for metabolic and cardiovascular conditions.
