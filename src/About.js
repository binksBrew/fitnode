      <div className="about-content">
        <p>
          At <strong>Jeelo</strong>, our ambition is to redefine healthcare through innovation, making it proactive, personalized, and accessible. With <strong>FitNode</strong>, our visionary brand, we aim to address one of the most pressing challenges of modern healthcare: preventing diseases before they occur. Under the FitNode umbrella, we are proud to introduce <strong>BioLoop</strong>, a revolutionary health companion designed to guide individuals toward a healthier and more balanced lifestyle.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          We envision a future where preventable diseases are no longer a threat. A future where individuals are empowered with the tools and knowledge to take control of their well-being. FitNode is committed to making healthcare more proactive, enabling everyone to live healthier, longer, and more fulfilling lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our vision extends beyond just health monitoring—it’s about fostering a global movement that prioritizes wellness and preventive care. Through cutting-edge technology and personalized insights, we aim to transform healthcare from a reactive model to a system that actively prevents chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.
        </p>

        <h2>The Problem We’re Solving</h2>
        <p>
          The current healthcare system is designed to treat illnesses after symptoms have already manifested. This reactive approach results in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Escalating healthcare costs.</li>
          <li>Preventable diseases reducing the quality of life for millions.</li>
          <li>A lack of personalized tools to guide individuals in maintaining their health.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Chronic conditions like diabetes, prediabetes, and hypertension are rapidly becoming an epidemic, affecting millions worldwide. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Nearly <strong>11.4%</strong> of India’s population is diabetic, with an additional <strong>10-12%</strong> being prediabetic.</li>
          <li>Over <strong>33%</strong> of individuals suffer from hypertension, with many cases remaining undiagnosed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          At FitNode, we believe it’s time to change this narrative.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Solution: The BioLoop Ecosystem</h2>
